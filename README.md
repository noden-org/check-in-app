# Noden Membership and Check-in App

## Non developer ü§î

This is where we build the Noden membership app. If you just want to use it. Go to the link [here üöÄ](https://noden-membership-app-production.up.railway.app)

## Hello developer üßë‚Äçüíª

This web app lets members sign up, manage and check their memberships. It also lets workshop leaders check memberships during workshops. It works by reaching out the [Moonclerk API](https://github.com/moonclerk/developer/blob/main/api/README.md) which we use for managing subscriptions, and checks for name and email against the active membership database.

A server side app is needed here, because the Moonclerk API returns all of the users with a lot of sensitive information. The webpage simply queries the server side app with a name/email, and the server only returns whether or not they have an active membership. 

The app is built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and includes a static webpage which reaches out the backend portion of the app. That's where the Moonclerk API requests are processed and filtered before displaying to the user.

## Get started

### Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Add the Moonclerk API key

1. Rename `.env.template` to `.env`
1. Update the value of the `MOONCLERK_API_KEY` to the real key . It should look something like this: `56772fc8d647856b7204ebc25346a6a0`.

### Run on http://localhost:5100

```sh
npn run dev
```

### Real deployment

The app is currently deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app). Reach out to [Raj](https://github.com/siliconwitch) for access.
